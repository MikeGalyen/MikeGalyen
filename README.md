Hi, I'm Mike Galyen and I'm currently attending University of Maryland Global Campus and looking for my first development job. I will graduate in Summer 2022 and my degree is a B.S. in Software Development and Security. I am naturally analytical and inquisitive and my favorite things to do are learning new coding languages and technologie stacks. I love application security because it provides me the opportunity to constantly learn and explore new things.
